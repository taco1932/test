## To do:
- [ ] Fix KDB parsing for faces (changed in 7.3)
- [ ] Figure out Unknown 2 in TMB/SGB (probably CRC)
- [ ] CUTB nonsense
- [ ] Put together .py code to manually update npc_files.json
- [ ] Add more to common_tmb list
- [ ] Fix SGB selection for housing items
- [ ] Add stuff from EObj to SGB selection
- [ ] More SGB parsing
- [ ] Figure out why the icon in the plugin menu isn't cooperating, even though it's a valid link
- [ ] additional file types for parsing? (tried this with AMB, but I don't know what I'm doing in C#)
